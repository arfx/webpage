**Guide**

1.  Download Dropbox on your PC, as well as downloading Dropbox and Dropsync onto your Android.
    
2.  Copy your vault from the original location and paste it into your Dropbox. Go into Obsidian and make a new vault from the files you just pasted. Delete your original vault if you want to. (Note that this is what I did, I don’t know what happens if you move your files from the original location to Dropbox and how it affects the Obsidian app on PC.)
    
3.  Open Dropbox on your phone. Download your vault from Dropbox into your device. Both Internal Storage and SD Card work fine, although if your vault has a lot of files and you have access to an SD Card, I suggest moving it there. Make sure you know where your files are so that you don’t lose them. _Scroll down to the Troubleshooting section of this guide if Dropbox won’t let you download your vault files._
    
4.  Open Dropsync. It will tell you to allow permissions to your storage. Allow that, then log into your Dropbox account. Once all of that is finished, go ahead and click Choose what to sync.
    
5.  Choose Let me create my own folder pair. Going from top to bottom, pick a name for your folder pair. After that, go to Remote folder and choose your vault from Dropbox. Make sure to choose your main folder and not a subfolder (aka the contents of your vault).
    
6.  Go to local folder and find your vault files that you downloaded in step 3. Make sure to choose the main folder here as well. Choose the sync method as Two-way and the four options after can be chosen to your liking. Enable folder pair if needed then press save.
    
7.  It will then start to sync your folders together. Let it finish, that you are done. Make sure to go to the Obsidian app and open the vault from the location you saved it at on your phone if you haven’t done so already.
