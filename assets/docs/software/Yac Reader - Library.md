hey I just found today out what is the issue with the missing grid thumbnails. My many library Folder has an "#" in front of the name, for example my folder path looks like F:#Comic... (to sort that folder in the explorer always to the top). If I remove that "#"all grid picture are again visible. Is this something you can fix ![ü•∫](https://discord.com/assets/6bca769662f755d33514d1f5304c617d.svg) or should I change my better global folder ![üò¢](https://discord.com/assets/f6d30507f4baee759bc9d7e5c0d3ba4f.svg) .
