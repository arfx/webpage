# Impact Frames

Since I love Impact Frames, I was very early ready to invest more time in it as well.

I had also been playing around with post FX shaders for a few weeks before, especially for impact frame moments. Even if I had a good first approach with it, these results were always too static for me. Which is why I switched to hand-drawn impact frames during the course of the progress.

Or better I mix of both , I made my drawing with transparent background and used the invert flip from the post FX shader and the InEngine footage.

### Engine Shader - Post Effect

In the beginning it was very important for me that I could animated some of these values also over the sequence, which I shared some parameters and added then in the Global Post Process as “Post Process Material”.

### Drawing

The Drawing Process was quite I started with a still inverted Frame from the Engine and drew over it.
