# SFX

For the final release, the video would need audio or sound effects (SFX). However, this is an area where I had my weaknesses and lack of experience. So, I recognize in the process of that Sequence that this poses another completely new challenge for me.

 ðŸ†“ For that I looked into some free SFX sites

I started by putting some random SFX together in the Blenders Sequencer together, but I havenÂ´t found everything that I wanted. Also, they definitely needed some tweaking because some were why to long or short in length and I think too high (if that is the right term in that context), etc. Also, I needed really fast some rough timing which I did in Blender by importing the Image Sequence from the Export Unreal Scene via Movie Render Queue.

After that, I looked at some tools that can create SFX and audacity came right to my mind. (With worries and fears because I was often struggling that tool. ) But with a bit of help from a Friend (programmer + musician, best combo for that) we create something in it. But he moved me a bit away from that so that we ended up in [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/download.php), we I created most of these ending noise/beep(peep) SFX.
