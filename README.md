Hi, my name is Anton and I am a Senior VFX Artist at Tuatara Games (previously at Ubisoft Germany BlueByte - Lead VFX Artist) and currently located in Brandenburg/Germany close to Berlin.

I love VFX since I found out it exists during my student time at the Games Academy Berlin 2012-2014. There I focused already very quickly on real-time VFX and Shader.

Why I could start directly after the Academy directly as a Junior VFX / Technical Artist at Ubisoft Germany - DÃ¼sseldorf (at that time Ubisoft Blue Byte). Since then I worked there on Champions of Anteria and multiple Unannounced Projects in VFX Artist roles. Often with many overlaps in Technical Art and later as well as Lead role with mentoring multiple Junior VFX Artists.

After almost 7 years I left Ubisoft Germany to join Tuatara Games and learn and grow even further as VFX Artist. Now I do even more awesome VFX work and combine that with my interest in Technical stuff with procedural art (Houdini) as well,
